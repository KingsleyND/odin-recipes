    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When it comes to grilled barbecue chicken, everyone wants a nice thick barbecue glaze attached to the skin, and the only way to do it is to brush it on as it cooks. But because barbecue sauce has such a high sugar content, it only takes a minute for it to go from brick red to solid black — so you have to be careful! To ensure a sticky, sweet glaze that's not burnt, I sear the skin quickly, then cook it skin-side up on a covered grill, brushing on the glaze while it cooks. Because the glaze never touches the grilling surface, it doesn't burn.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into halves</li>
        <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut 1/2-inch deep slashes in the skin-side of each chicken half: two cuts in each breast, two in each thigh, and one in each leg. Remove wing tips</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the bowl and pat dry with paper towels; discard any remaining marinade.</li>
    </ol>
